imagine there are a array and an target number. if the target number could be provided by summing any 2 elements of this 
array we should return there is target, otherwise we should return there is any target number. Also it is presumed there 
are only one solution for target number. 


/**** question 

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

***example
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

***example
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

***example
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
